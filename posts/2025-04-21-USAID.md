I had the opportunity to listen to the stories of USAID workers and contractors who lost their livelihoods due to the current administration's questionable "cost-saving" budget cuts. 

Be angry. Be worried. We must do better.

## Lyrics

VERSE 1 
Following my marching orders 
Traveling to foreign soils 
Lend a hand
Work the land
On demand 
To be a part of a better plan 

Holding hands, trying to take a stand 
Birds and bees and planting trees, 
Getting people to read while 
Facing down some disease 
You saw from your TV screen 

PRE-CHORUS
64 years of opening doors
Lifting up voices, building bridges to a better world
You don’t know how much we gave
This ain’t some game that we play
We stand, we fight, we give, 
So others can live
and we never walk away


CHORUS
We are the people of
We are the people of 
USAID, USAID 
We are the people of 
We are the people of 
USAID, USAID 

VERSE 2
Now you’re gunning at me 
Saying something about liberty
And how America First 
Preserves our worth
By cutting ties to humanity 
 
There are lives at stake
You made it to the pyre 
Got smoke in your eyes while
Fanning the fire
You’re to blame when this goes up in flames

PRE-CHORUS
64 years of opening doors
Lifting up voices, building bridges to a better world
You don’t know how much we gave
This ain’t some game that we play
We stand, we fight, we give, 
So others can live
and we never walk away
