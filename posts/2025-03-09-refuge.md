excerpt: My grandparents celebrated 70 anniversaries together in Belfast Maine. That whole time there was this one facet of their relationship that the family always found kind of amusing. Lately it seems more amazing to me than amusing.

I wrote this song a few years ago, hoping I could stop singing it after a while. That hasn't happened. I am inviting others to sing it too.

## Lyrics
D There’s a Cat boat running with the G wind/
A which is blowin up a D gale
F#m Tryin to find a quiet Bm harbor/
 Em7 where she can drop her A sail
G rabbit lopin through the D meadow /
G moves with D out a A sound
F#m Camouflaged to/stay un Bm noticed/
G (Til he finds) his A (burrow un)der D ground
 
CHO G Be my refuge be my D shelter /
G... Be my D home and be my A land
G Be my refuge be my D shelter..Bm/
Em7/ would you A take me as I D am. Em7/ could you A take me as I D am.
 
D There’s a young man sailing through the G storm/
 A without a compass or a D chart
F#m Looking for a beacon he can Bm follow/
Em7 that will guide him through the A dark
G Not sure where he’s D headed/
or G if he should sur D render to the A tide
F#m all at once the fog is Bm lifting/
 G and the stars start A coming out to be his D guide
 CHO
INSTRUMENTAL
CHO
D Seems like this world’s in constant G motion /
A salmon swimming geese in D flight
F#m People/ fleeing war and Bm famine/
Em7 they keep movin' through the A night
G looking for a shore that D welcomes/
G north south D east or A west
F#m In our search for sanctu Bm ary/
G We’re all looking A for a place to D rest (2)
CHO
