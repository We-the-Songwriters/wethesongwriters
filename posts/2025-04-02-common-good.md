## Lyrics
His D daddy drove a fuel truck in Wy G oming/ 
A When he was a G kid he rode a D long /
 D Grew up and went off to G college// 
A in a small G town in Ore D gon / 
D Took a job in river G restoration/ 
A THAT one G summer changed his D life A G D  
They kept the G wild Columbia A flowing, the Bm Salmon running Em free// It was G clear he always would/, be 
A workin / for the common D good G A D
 
D After that he’s workin for the G County, 
Waste A water, roads and G bridges public D parks 
/ D pet adoption, dental care for G kids // 
A street lights for G safety in the D dark/ 
Workin D SEARCH and rescue in the Cascade G Range, 
fallen A mountain bikers G heart attacks and D more 
A G D / He G kept the  traffic A flowing, the Bm water running Em clean// 
It was G clear he always would / be
 A workin / for the common D good G A D
 
D now he’s workin / in the federal G service, 
A Getting people G knowledge that they D need /
D Making sure that help is easily G found 
by A folks who G cannot hear or D see /
 D Helping people understand G elections, A and what their G government has D done/
 A G D /He keeps the G information A flowing, 
Bm accessible by Em all//
 It was G clear he always would/, be 
A working / for the common D good G A D
 
D We are the feds, we get your mail de G livered, 
after A hurricanes G WE help you build D back 
/ D We protect your safety in your G workplace, 
in the A skies and G on the railroad D tracks/ 
We D work to keep the public G healthy, / 
A WE fight/ G to protect your D rights A G D / 
We G help our wounded A Veterans Bm to rebuild their Em lives// We G hope it’s understood/ we are 
A workin/ for the common D good G A D
 
D We live in every corner of this G country
From A Maine’s granite G shores to Ida D ho
D In Texas Illinois and Kansas G City
A We all work for G you/ we hope you D know A G D / 
We keep the G wild Columbia A flowing, the Bm Salmon running Em free//
We G hope it’s understood/ we are A workin/ for the common D good G A D
