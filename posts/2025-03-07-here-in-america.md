excerpt: I've never been particularly politically active, other than voting regularly, but recent events have made me feel so powerless, angry, and sad. Writing this song was just one way I could think of to help in whatever way I can. It's part expression of my own feelings, part "Schoolhouse Rock" lesson, and part call to action.<br><br><i>This is an example of a lyric video. You don't have to be on camera, if you don't want to.</i>
