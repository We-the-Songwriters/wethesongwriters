# We the Songwriters: Code of conduct

We the Songwriters is a community where federal workers and songwriters come together to tell the stories of our dedicated federal workers and the people they serve who are impacted by current policies. This is a safe, inclusive, and supportive community that welcomes members from varied backgrounds, identities, and musical genres.

To foster this sense of community and stay focused on our shared mission, we ask all community members to abide by this code of conduct in all community activities, events, and digital forums:
Respect each person’s confidentiality and safety. We aim to create a space where all community members can safely explore the vulnerability inherent in songwriting. We ask that all community members respect each others’ confidentiality and refrain from sharing more broadly anything shared in private cowriting sessions without permission. And We the Songwriters will not tolerate any type of harassment or abuse in any form. If someone makes you—or another person—feel unsafe in this community, we ask you to tell us at [wethesongwriters2025@gmail.com](mailto:wethesongwriters2025@gmail.com) right away.

## Be open and encouraging, with a spirit of presuming and uplifting the value of others. 
We aim to help people from all backgrounds, identities, and songwriting abilities share deeply human stories. We do that by being open with our own ideas and talents and encouraging others’ ideas and talents. We ask that all community members respect the value inherent in each individual’s story, regardless of whether they can personally relate to that story or the way it’s told through song. And while no community member is obligated to share or promote any other community member’s songs, we ask that all community members who do engage in sharing or promoting songs created through We the Songwriters do so only in positive, uplifting ways.

## Be mindful of self-promotion. 
We aim to build community and help federal workers tell their own stories through song. When members use our communication channels to promote individual creative projects or products, we can quickly erode the sense of community and trust. We don’t want to shift the focus away from the people whose stories we aim to tell.

## Center the songs on the storytellers. 
Storytellers own their stories and decide what they are comfortable sharing both in songs and any related promotions. 


## Center the experience on the storyteller. 
Federal workers impacted by current policies are dealing with intense, rapidly evolving pressures and trauma, whether they’ve been terminated from or currently remain in their roles. As songwriting pairs, we aim to collaborate in an open, respectful, and understanding way, at a pace that allows federal workers the space they need to deal with their current situation day to day.


## Use your own skills, your own words, and your own humanity. 
We aim to tell human stories, written by humans for humans. We ask that all community members avoid the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in songwriting.


## Respect the right of storytellers to determine their anonymity over time. 
Federal workers will have varying levels of comfort with having their name attached to their story and song. This comfort level may change over time, with a storyteller needing anonymity at first and then being interested in sharing public credit over time. We encourage each songwriting pair to determine their approach to sharing credit for their song in a way that respects each person’s contributions and safety.


## Follow all applicable copyright laws. 
We the Songwriters is an organically built community with no formal legal counsel or income base. We the Songwriters operates solely to bring together works and songwriters to foster and promote a collaborative process to share stories through music. We cannot give legal advice to members or take on defense of copyright issues. Songwriters and workers who create songs through We the Songwriters will own the copyright for their songs and are responsible for allocating, protecting, or enforcing any related copyright issues.


## Avoid causing harm through songs. 
We encourage songs that explore all aspects of federal service and the impact of current policies, including songs that push strongly against harm and oppression. But we reserve the right to decline to share or promote any song that actively promotes hate, harm, or discrimination against any person or group of people.
